                            The layout of the map is as shown below, with the small green dots representing the waypoints.

                            <p class="mb-1">Unfortunately, I was unable to achieve accurate and reliable localization results using my ToF sensor data and the provided 
                                localization program, which I documented in my Lab 11 writeup. Even though my polar plot of the ToF sensor readings looked like the robot's
                                surroundings, the localization algorithm would predict the wrong location the majority of the time. If I had more time, I would continue
                                to debug my localization since it is the most reliable way to complete Lab 12; however, I had to leave campus early, so I will not be using
                                localization in my map navigation, as it will likely provide innacurate results. 
                            </p>    
                            <p class="mb-1">
                                Instead, I will still try to be as accurate as possible with my navigation by using feedback control to detect the robot's current state
                                and determine its next move. My approach divides the map traversal into two parts: straight-line forward pathing and counterclockwise
                                rotation. At every waypoint, the robot rotates to a set angle using closed-loop feedback control. The decision to continue rotating or
                                stop depends on the input yaw value received from the robot's IMU. This method works well because the IMU performs very rapid data collection,
                                so the angle that the robot turns to is relatively precise and consistent. To travel from waypoint to waypoint, the robot is programmed
                                to move forward a certain distance by driving the motors for a predetermined period of time. This open-loop method for straight-line movement
                                is used because my robot's ToF sensors sometimes mistakenly detect things that are not there, causing it to output inaccurate measurements that
                                are much lower than they should be. Since the navigation task is quite long, I would need the ToF sensors to consistently output accurate 
                                readings, so I decided to forego this method. In the end, I found that this combination of turning and moving forward worked sufficiently well
                                for my robot to navigate the map.

                            </div>
                              <p class="mb-1">I implemented my navigation algorithm using code that resembles a state machine, where the robot can either be in a "move
                                  forward" state or a "rotate" state. I defined a function, <code>angle_turn()</code>, which uses yaw feedback to turn the car a specified
                                  number of degrees. It calculates the difference between the current yaw and <code>begin_angle</code>, which is the yaw at which the robot began rotation,
                                  and stops when the desired number of degrees has been reached. There are a total of 13 states, one for each movement the robot takes
                                  to traverse the map. After each movement is completed, the <code>state_change_flag</code> is raised; this flag is handled at the end of the code, where
                                  the <code>begin_angle</code> variable is updated to the current yaw, the state variable is incremented to move on to the next state, and the <code>state_change_flag</code>
                                  is reset to 0. All of this code is nested within the <code>while (central.connected())</code> block, so it begins execution when the robot
                                  connects to my laptop over Bluetooth and continues to run in a loop until disconnected.

                              <p class="mb-1">Here is a video of my robot navigating through the maze and successfully hitting all of the waypoint squares. Throughout the testing
                                  process, I observed that the performance of the robot varied drastically depending on the voltage of the battery supplying power to the motors,
                                  and this caused more inconsistency than I had anticipated. The rotation of the robot at each waypoint was not affected much because it was close-loop,
                                  but the forward movements often fell short or overshot the desired distance. Since the entire navigation sequence is 13 states long, and the success of hitting each state depended on the accuracy of the state before it, it took a while
                                  to tune each movement to be accurate; even in the successful run video, the robot is not perfectly centered at every waypoint. However, I tried
                                  my best within the limited time that I had, and I hope the result is sufficient to show that my robot is able to perform navigation using my semi-closed-loop
                                  algorithm.

                        <p> Thank you to all the TAs for making this class as intriguing and fun as it was rigorous. I was able to explore a variety of topics in robotics,
                            and I am excited to continue following my passion for robotics into the future. I am especially thankful for my Wednesday lab TAs, Anya and Jonathan,
                            who patiently explained confusing concepts to me, were very willing to spend time to help me debug my robot, and were overall the most supportive and kind TAs I have had <3
