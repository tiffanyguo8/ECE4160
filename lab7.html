                        <hr class="divider divider-light" />
                        <p> In this lab, I implemented a Kalman filter for my robot. The Kalman filter supplements sampled ToF sensor values
                            in order to achieve more granular data, which can be use to execute more precise movement control. The goal is to 
                            find the optimal combination of ToF data and position prediction based on pwm input to find the most precise estimate
                            of the robot's actual position. With this increased control, the robot will be able to speed more quickly towards the
                            wall while still stopping at precisely the 1 ft setpoint distance. </p>

                                In order to create a suitable Kalman filter for my robot, I first defined a state space model based off of Prof. Petersen's
                                lecture. The model is as follows:
                                
                                <img src="assets/img/kf_state_space.png" alt="State Space Model" width=60% height=auto/>
                                
                                In this model, let's define matrix A as the square matrix with the -d/m term, and matrix B as the [0, 1/m] matrix. 
                                These matrices involve the d and m coefficients, which represent the drag and momentum of the robot as it moves.
                                The equations for d and m are as follows:
                                
                                <img src="assets/img/kf_d_m.png" alt="Drag and Momentum equations" width=60% height=auto/>
                                
                                In order to find the values of drag and momentum for my robot, I triggered a step response and measured the ToF sensor readings and PWM 
                                input as the robot moved. I drove the robot at a PWM of 80, since that was the approximate speed it drove during PID in the previous lab. 
                                I then plotted graphs of the position (u), pwm, and velocity (x') of the robot:

                                From these graphs, I can determine the steady state velocity, which is the (peak) velocity at which the robot stops accelerating,
                                and the 90% rise time, which is the time it takes to reach 90% of the steady state velocity. These values are then used to calculate drag and
                                momentum using the previous equations.

                               stop it when it reaches exactly 304cm from the wall. The input to the PID controller is the distance readings from the time
                               of flight sensor, and the output is the new PWM values used to drive the motors.

                               Implementing the PID algorithm is simple, but the challenge comes from finding suitable constants for a well-tuned system.

                            I simply raised them to the minimum driving pwm. I also capped the maximum pwm value at 255 since that is the maximum duty cycle
                            of the motors. Below is a compilation of videos I took throughout the process of adjusting the PID parameters. I start out by turning
                            up the P and D terms, then decreasing them and adding the I term so that the robot can stop short of the wall and correct its position.

                                    the 304cm setpoint distance, the pwm dips into the negatives to reverse the car's position and bring it closer to the setpoint.

                                    I made the arrays for storing TOF and speed data 1000 ints long, so given that my TOF sensors sample new data roughly 2 times
                                    per second, my data structure can hold approximately 500 seconds of data, or over 8 minutes. With these structures as well as
                                    additional arrays I created to store the time and imu readings, my code used 37% of dynamic memory during compilation, meaning
